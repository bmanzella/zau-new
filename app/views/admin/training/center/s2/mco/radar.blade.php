                            <p>All ATCT's are VFR in its purest form, however some busier airports, mainly class B airports, have Tower Display Workstations. This is essentially a television screen utilised by air traffic control to ensure separation of arriving, and sometimes departing aircraft, and also allows for VFR transitions which will be covered in a further chapter.</p>
                            <p>The only ZJX airport to use a radar facility is Orlando International (KMCO). This is due to the number of parallel runways, and number of consecutive arrivals and departures by the hour.</p>

                            <p>Side step procedures are used in multiple scenarios. Traffic could be late to vacate or depart a runway, a pilot may request it, or for runway conditions.</p>
                            <p>Example: (Southwest 213 is on final approach for 17R and previous traffic is yet to vacate)</p>
                            <p><em>Southwest 213, side step runway 17L, wind calm, runway 17L cleared to land.</em></p>
                            <p>Restating the runway, even during single runway operations, is highly recommended to ensure the pilot catches the side step maneuver.</p>
