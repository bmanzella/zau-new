                            <p>The only time a VFR aircraft will utilize Clearance Delivery is when they want Flight Following, or are at a Class B or C airport. VFR aircraft are not required to file a flight plan.</p>
                            <p>Flight Following is a service offered for VFR aircraft by the radar controller to provide radar services for traffic advisories and other important advisories such as pointing out active special use airspace, etc. This service is issued based on controller workload only and is not mandatory. That being said, if a VFR aircraft requests flight following from a class delta field, please contact the appropriate departure controller to confirm that they are able to accept flight following for that aircraft before clearance is issued. In a class charlie or bravo field, they will need to talk to the departure controller in any case and the departure controller can make the decision at the time. </p>
                            <p>If flight following is requested or approved, place "VFF" or "FF" in the scratchpad entry. </p>
                            <p><strong>If a VFR aircraft is departing a Class D field and is NOT requesting flight following, NO delivery is required and the pilot will call ground for taxi. </strong></p>

                            <p>Remember RAFT? Issuing VFR clearances is easy. You are only clearing them VFR at a certain altitude (<strong>applicable only in Class B and C airspace</strong>), a departure frequency, and a beacon code for their transponder. For Class B airports, you must clear them into the Bravo airspace. If it's slow, coordinate with the departure radar controller to see whether or not they wish to leave VFR aircraft capped at or below a certain altitude before issuing VFR clearances. Let's get a VFR flight going.</p>
