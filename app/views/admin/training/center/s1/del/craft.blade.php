                            <p>When giving IFR Clearances, usage of the acronym CRAFT will help you remember the order to give the clearance and that you give the pilot all the necessary information. VFR aircraft at Class B and C airport will use the same format, without the C, and be given clearance into the Class B (no clearance into Class C is required).</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>C</strong> - Clearance Limit. The point they are cleared up to. Generally, this will be the destination airport unless it is a military aircraft with a point of VFR in their route (IE, a "VR" (VFR Training Route), or "VFR" where they will terminate VFR). <strong>Please always include the word "airport" in the clearance if the clearance limit is an airport.</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>R</strong> - Route. This will generally be their SID (Standard Instrument Departure), or Radar Vectors to their first point. If local procedures apply, you will say "<strong>as filed</strong>" in which the pilot is expected to fly as they filed unless any other restrictions are added. </li>
                            <li><strong>A</strong> - Altitude. The initial and cruise altitude are given here along with the time expected to be cleared to the cruise altitude. If the pilot as a SID, their time or distance to expect their cruise may be reflected in the SID, otherwise you will stick to local procedures. <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: </strong>If the aircraft is departing a field with <strong>NO </strong>SID, the initial and requested cruise altitude are given in the clearance. If the aircraft is departing <strong>WITH</strong> a SID, "Climb Via Sid" Phraeseology is given instead. </li>
                            <li><strong>F</strong> - Frequency. This is the Radar Departure Frequency. It will be either Center or a Departure controller. If no radar controller is online, the departure frequency wlll be UNICOMM, 122.8</li>
                            <li><strong>T</strong> - Transponder. You will assign them a Squawk Code to put in their transponder.</li>

MTN7522 (Mountain Air Cargo) has this flight plan route CTY OCF LEESE2 from Tallahassee (KTLH) to Orlando International (KMCO) cruising at 7000 feet.

We have JBU678 on the ground at KJAX, requesting IFR to KJFX as filed. He has "SAV CHS J121 SIE CAMRN4" as his route, with a cruise of 39,000 feet.  He is UNABLE to fly a SID.

                            <p>VFR clearance is less complicated than IFR clearance and may vary slightly depending on the class of airport departing <strong>AND</strong> local procedures. Its uses the RAFT or AFT portion of CRAFT depending on the airspace. </p>
                            <p>Let's consider N517CC , Beech King Air who would like VFR clearance from the <strong>Bravo</strong> field KMCO to KTLH requesting 16500 feet and a route of OCF CTY SZW. Keep in mind that the filed routing and altitude is of <strong>NO</strong> consequence when giving VFR clearance at <strong>any</strong> field. </p>
