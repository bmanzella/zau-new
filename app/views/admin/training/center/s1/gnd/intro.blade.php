                            <p>Essentially, the ground controller is responsible for everything on the ground. They are the guys that get vehicles around the airfield, planes to the runway, and back to the terminal, and assist the local controller in ensuring a clear deck. While it sounds easy, a busy ground is harder to control than it sounds. The advantage of this control position is that aircraft can hold their position.</p>
