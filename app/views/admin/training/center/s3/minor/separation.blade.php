                                    You may separate aircraft vertically provided they both have valid Mode-C readouts. In order to separate vertically, you may assign altitudes to comply with the above separation requirements. However, vertical separation may only be used when the aircraft is level, in other words, if you may only issue a descent to an altitude when the previous aircraft at that altitude has started a descent.
                                    Methods to vertically separate targets:
                                    <li style="color:lightskyblue;"> Assign altitudes to aircraft, provided valid Modeâ€‰C altitude information is monitored and the applicable separation minima is maintained at all times.
                                    <li style="color:lightskyblue;">Assign an altitude to an aircraft after the aircraft previously at that altitude has been issued a climb/descent clearance and is observed, or reports, leaving the altitude.
                                    <li style="color:red;">Minimum Radar Separation Vertically is 1000ft.
