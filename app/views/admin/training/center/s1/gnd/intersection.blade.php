                            <p>Intersection departures are where an aircraft requests to depart a runway from an intersection of a taxiway and the runway other than the taxi at the departure end of the runway (Full Length). If an aircraft requests this, you would append it to the runway at the beginning of the taxi route and the distance remaining: Runway (designator) at (taxiway), taxi via (route) (holding instructions as necessary). Runway (designator) at (taxiway) intersection departure, (feet available) feet available.</p>
