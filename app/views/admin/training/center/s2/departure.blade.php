                            <p>Launching IFR aircraft often time requires a release from the departure radar controller. The reason behind this is they often times have other aircraft that are in the vicinity and space needs to be created to work in the new departure. Some local procedures have automatic releases in effect until departure says otherwise, but it's always best to coordinate this ahead of time. Currently all of your Bravo and Charlie fields are utilizing automatic releases.</p>
                            <p><strong>Class Delta Fields Always require a release.</strong></p>
                            <p>Example: <br /><em>Tower: Departure, (your facility) Tower, request release.<br /> Departure: Departure<br /> Tower: Request release, United 151, JFK, runway 5L.<br /> Departure: United 151, Heading 090, released. AW<br /> Tower: SY</em></p>
                            <p>In the above, the aircraft was released with a departure heading 090. Other responses is "Released" on runway heading or a heading you select for separation, and "Hold for release" which means just like it sounds, the aircraft is currently not authorized to depart until you get a call back.</p>

                            <p>Once the aircraft is released, scan the runway and the arrival corridor. If you have adequate spacing and the runway is clear and appropriate wake turbulence separation has been applied, then clear the aircraft for takeoff.</p>
                            <p>Takeoff clearances consist of the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>Wind (if applicable) [not "WINDS"] - The current wind, only required to be read when a tailwind component exists OR the aircraft is a military aircraft. If military, you must <strong>always</strong> read the wind. <u>Wind 240 at 3</u></li>
                            <li>Additional instructions, as necessary - This includes a departure heading, example <u>Turn right heading 090</u>.</li>
                            <li>Runway - State the runway the aircraft is departing on. This is optional when only one runway is in use.</li>
                            <li>Clearance - State the phrase <u>Cleared for takeoff</u></li>
                            <li>If a military aircraft other than a cargo or transport aircraft, include the phrase "Change to departure"</li>

                            <p>Pilot Nav Departures provide a path from the departure point to the exit (transition) point. They are managed by the FMC (Flight Management Computer) as the aircraft lifts off the runway.</p>
                            <p>Take a look at this example from KCHS.</p>
                            <p><img src="http://healthcentraled.com/images/MLTRE2dp.png" alt="" width="50%" /></p>
                            <p>Let's assume that the active runway is RW 15. The FMC once activated will begin a left turn to ANGRE at 560 feet then it will fly the rest of the SID as published.</p>
                            <p>Pilot nav takeoff phraseology encorporates the name of the first FIX in the clearance.</p>
                            <p>EXAMPLE: DAL247 Heavy, Charleston Tower, wind 140@8, RNAV to ANGRE, runway 15, Cleared for Takeoff.</p>

                            <p>Intersection departures may be initiated by a controller or pilot request. Issue the measured distance from intersection to runway end rounded down to nearest 50 feet to all departing aircraft, if known. In VATSIM this is usually an approximation based on the airport diagram. The other difference is you must specify the intersection location with the Runway number in the takeoff clearance.</p>

                            <p>Wake Turbulence is defined as turbulence that is created by an aircraft that is passing through the atmosphere. The term also includes vortices, thrust stream turbulence, jet blast, jet wash, propeller wash, and rotor wash both on the ground and in the air. Generally, the heavier the aircraft the more wake turbulence that is generated. This occurs in all stages of flight, but is most prominent in the departure and approach phases of flight. Wake Turbulence is unpredictable by nature, and because of this, controllers are not responsible for anticipating its existence or effects. Although Wake Turbulence is not modeled by default in Flight Simulator, we as controllers are still responsible for providing appropriate separation due to Wake Turbulence.</p>

                            <p>For the purposes of Wake Turbulence Separation aircraft are classified as Heavy, Large, or Small.

                            <li>Heavy aircraft are capable of takeoff weights of <strong>300,000</strong> pounds or more whether or not they are operating at this weight during a particular phase of flight. Some examples are most 707/C-135, all 747, 767, DC-10, L-1011, A-300, C-5, C-141, C-17, and B-52.</li>
                            <li>Large aircraft are aircraft of more than 41,000 pounds but less than 300,000 pounds maximum takeoff weight. Most military, Air Carrier, and other non-General Aviation aircraft are Large.</li>
                            <li>Small aircraft are aircraft of 41,000 pounds or less maximum takeoff weight. Most General Aviation aircraft are Small and most weigh 12,500 lbs or less.</li>
