                            When initiating the handoff the following items must be included:
                            <li> The Phrase "Point Out"
                            <li>The location of the aircraft, unless physically pointing to the controller's screen.
                            <li>The aircraft callsign, or squawk code if no callsign is displayed
                            <li>The Altitude of the aircraft

                            Once the receiving controller identifies the aircraft, he will issue one of the following instructions:

                            <li>"POINTOUT APPROVED" - If the receiving controller states this, then your aircraft can enter his airspace as requested, and you can retain control of the aircraft.

                            <li>"RADAR CONTACT" - If the receiving controller states this, then in order for your aircraft to enter his airspace, you must hand the aircraft off to him.

                            <li>"YOUR CONTROL" - If the receiving controller states this, then you can do whatever you want to do with your aircraft inside of his airspace.

                            <li>"UNABLE" - If the receiving controller states this, then your aircraft may not enter his airspace at all.
